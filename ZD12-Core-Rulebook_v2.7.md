# Foreword

## The Invitation to Tinker, A Creator's Thanks

### A Note from the Fringes

For the longest time, I’ve been a happy resident of the hobby’s fringes. I suspect some of you live there, too. It’s a great place. The view is wonderful. From the edge, you’re not just playing the game in front of you; you’re looking at its architecture, its bones. You’re less concerned with the "correct" way to play and far more fascinated by its narrative potential, by the beautiful, intricate machinery humming just beneath the surface. And a special thanks†[^1] to the readers who understand intuitively how systems can be both rigorous and mythological, why emergent complexity doesn't require complicated rules, and why a good footnote is worth the page space.

### My notebooks are a Graveyard

of beautiful, dead-end ideas born from this perspective. I've always been more interested in the potential of mechanics than their strict application.

My design process has always been a restless, meandering conversation with other systems, a constant internal monologue of playful deconstruction. "What would happen if we just... opened up these options?" "This one rule would be really cool as its own contained subsystem, because then you could link it to this other system over here, and they'd resonate in a really interesting way..." And on, and on. It’s a process of constant, joyful tinkering.

### ZD12 is the logical—perhaps inevitable—

manifestation of that approach. It isn’t an attempt to be the definitive game. It’s the opposite. It’s an attempt to build the most inviting, adaptable, and philosophically open starting point I could imagine.

### The Philosophy of the d12

This game is built on a few core assumptions:

- The goal is the story. Rules are the scaffolding, not the building. They should be strong enough to hold things up, but light enough to disappear when you don’t need them.

- Overhead is the enemy of momentum. We want a game that anyone can pick up and play quickly, a system where the time from "I have an idea" to "we are playing" is as short as humanly possible.

- Attachment is everything. We want you to become attached to the world and your characters, to feel the weight of their choices and the thrill of their successes. This happens when the rules get out of the way and let the fiction breathe.

- Hacking is not a bug; it's the primary feature. This is the most important part.

### This is my contribution to a conversation.

Now, it's your opportunity to respond.

My wish is that ZD12 one day enriches the hobby as much as the hobby has enriched me.

Welcome to the workshop.

Zethican

Lead Designer, ZD12 RPG SYSTEM

# The ZD12 Design Philosophy

Our design is governed by a few core directives:

- Meaningful Choices: From the gear you carry to the Stance you take in a fight, every decision has a mechanical impact. The game is built on a series of risk/reward trade-offs that empower players to think tactically.

- The d12 is King: The twelve-sided die is the heart of the system. Its probability curve provides satisfying results, and its use in every core mechanic creates a powerful, unified game feel. By keeping static bonuses low, we ensure the result of the d12 roll is always the most exciting and significant part of any check. The roll itself is the moment of drama.

- Forward Momentum: The core resolution mechanic is designed to always push the narrative forward. There are no "whiff" turns where nothing happens; every roll has consequences, introducing success, failure, or a mix of both with new complications.

- Structured Flexibility: We provide clear, intuitive structures (like Gambits, Clocks, and the Net Fulcrum) that empower on-the-fly rulings and player creativity, rather than restricting them with complex rules. The goal is a game that is easy to learn but offers deep strategic potential.

## Setting Agnostic, Tone Specific

ZD12 is designed to be setting-agnostic, capable of running adventures from gritty low-fantasy to arcane sci-fi. However, it is built with a specific tone in mind: ZD12 excels at telling stories about competent characters facing high-stakes situations where consequences matter. The world is dangerous, success is not guaranteed, and every choice can have a tangible impact on the narrative.

## The Rhythm of Combat

Forget what you know about the steady, attritional grind of combat. A fight in ZD12 is not a straight line to victory; it's the cinematic rhythm of a great action scene—a pulse of desperate moments followed by heroic, tide-turning counters.

The engine for this is Grit, and it works differently here. Grit is a comeback currency, a resource you earn through adversity. It's generated when you fail, when you push your luck and suffer a complication, or when an enemy lands a staggering blow. Success, while advancing your goals, will drain your resources.

### This is the core of the ebb and flow.

After a string of triumphant actions, you’ll find yourself in the ebb—a tense, low-Grit moment where your flashiest abilities are out of reach. This is by design. This is where you must rely on cunning, teamwork, and the environment to survive. It's the moment the hero is disarmed and must fight with their wits and grit in the literal sense.

But this struggle is what fuels the flow. The Grit you earn from weathering the storm will power your heroic crescendo. You will unleash devastating Signature Moves, bend the laws of probability, and create the spectacular moments that everyone at the table will remember.

Don't fear the low points. They are the tension that makes the release of your power so satisfying. Welcome to cinematic combat.

# Part I: The Player's Guide

## Chapter 1: Character Creation

Creating a ZD12 character is a straightforward, seven-step process designed to establish a unique, competent adventurer quickly.

### System Canon: The Hybrid System

ZD12 uses a hybrid system for character creation that combines the guided progression of Archetypes with the customization of Attribute Points. A player first selects their character's Archetype, which determines their available skills and special abilities. Separately, the player receives a pool of Attribute Points to customize their character's core Attribute scores. These two choices are distinct but complementary, allowing for both a strong thematic identity and granular personalization.

### Step 1: Choose Your Archetype & Concept

Once you have a concept, choose an Archetype. This provides the core of your character's mechanical identity, establishing your starting skills, abilities, and thematic role in a party.

- The Stalwart: A resilient melee-oriented archetype focused on MGT. You are a bulwark against your foes, a master of arms and armor who protects your allies.

- The Shadow: A quick and cunning archetype focused on AGI. You thrive in the shadows, striking from unexpected angles and exploiting your enemies' weaknesses.

- The Strategist: A brilliant and tactical archetype focused on WIT. You overcome obstacles with your intellect, whether through ancient lore, cunning invention, or battlefield strategy.

- The Savant: A deeply empathic channeler archetype focused on SPI. Your strength comes from inner conviction, channeling potent energies through Relics and your own willpower.

### Step 2: Choose Your Background

Next, select a Background. This choice adds narrative flavor and grants your character one free skill proficiency from a short, thematic list, representing their life experiences. This proficiency does not count against the total you select in Step 4.

- Artifact Tender: Gain proficiency in Academics or Insight.

- City Guard: Gain proficiency in Investigation or Intimidation.

- Urchin: Gain proficiency in Stealth or Thievery.

- Scribe: Gain proficiency in Academics or Perception.

- Hunter: Gain proficiency in Survival or Stealth.

- Acolyte: Gain proficiency in Persuasion or Insight.

- Tinkerer: Gain proficiency in Mechanics or Investigation.

### Step 3: Assign Attribute Scores

You have 6 points to distribute among your four primary Attributes. At character creation, a score can range from 0 to a maximum of +3.

- Might (MGT): Raw physical power, endurance, and brute force.

- Agility (AGI): Finesse, speed, precision, and reflexes.

- Wits (WIT): Knowledge, perception, deduction, and technical skill.

- Spirit (SPI): Willpower, focus, charisma, and magical attunement.

### Step 4: Choose Skill Proficiencies

You may now choose a number of skill proficiencies from the Skill List equal to 2 + your Wits (WIT) modifier.

### Step 5: Calculate Derived Statistics

Once your Attributes are set, calculate your derived stats.

- Health Points (HP): Your physical durability. Your starting HP is equal to 10 + MGT

- Grit: Your heroic potential. All characters begin encounters with 0 Grit, and generate them during combat. Only player characters are eligible for the Grit system.

- Defense: Your passive ability to avoid attacks, equal to your base AGI score.

### Step 6: Select Abilities

Your character's special abilities are what set them apart.

- Signature Moves: Choose two Signature Moves from the library in Appendix A. These are reliable techniques, often fueled by Grit, that reflect your Archetype's training.

- The Path of the Specialist: Alternatively, if your primary Attribute modifier is +2 or higher, you may forgo choosing two Signature Moves. Instead, you can spend 1 Mastery Point (MP) to begin walking the Path of the Specialist, gaining access to powerful but risky abilities.

#### The Path of the Specialist: High-Stakes Investment

While most characters define their power through broad skill and versatile Signature Moves, a Specialist learns to draw upon the raw, chaotic currents of their core Attribute. This path is one of great power and greater risk, allowing access to abilities that transcend the normal rules of the game.

##### Becoming a Specialist

To walk a Path of the Specialist, a character must meet the following criteria:

- Attribute Requirement: The character must have an Attribute modifier of +2 or higher in the chosen path's Attribute.

- Investment: A character can choose to spend 1 Mastery Point (MP) to learn their first Thesis or Path ability.

##### The Specialist Die

A Specialist's power is channeled through their Specialist Die. The size of this die is determined solely by the character's Attribute modifier and remains constant between rests.

| Attribute Modifier | Specialist Die Size          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| +1                 | (Cannot become a Specialist) |
| +2                 | 1d10                         |
| +3                 | 1d12                         |

##### Backlash

If the Specialist Die result is a 1, the character suffers a Backlash. The specific effect is determined by the Specialist's unique Backlash table, listed below for your reference.

##### The Specialist Resolution

When a Specialist attempts an ability from their Path, they roll their Specialist Die, with the following outcomes:

- Result of 5 or higher: Success. The ability manifests perfectly as intended.

- Result of 2 to 4: Mixed Success. The ability works, but with a complication.

- Result of 1: Backlash! The raw power turns against the Specialist.

##### Specialist Backlash Tables

These tables are used when a Specialist rolls a 1 on their Specialist Die.

### Step 7: Gear Up

Finally, equip your character for adventure. Your inventory is managed through a simple slot system.

- Worn & Wielded Slots (5): For your armor, shield, and any weapons you want to draw quickly.

- Inventory Slots (8): For stowed items in your pack, like rope, rations, and supplies.

### ARMOR

#### Tier 0 (Light Armor & Clothing | +0 Bonus)

## Chapter 2: The Core Mechanic

All risky actions in ZD12—from swinging a sword to persuading a guard—are resolved using the same core mechanic. This loop keeps the game moving and ensures that every roll matters.

### The Core Check

To make a check, you roll a single twelve-sided die (1d12), add the relevant Attribute, and compare the result to a Target Number (TN) set by the GM.

Formula: 1d12 + Attribute vs. Target Number (TN)

Whenever a character attempts an action where the outcome is uncertain and carries a meaningful risk, the GM will call for a check. If the action is trivial (like walking across an empty room) or guaranteed to succeed, no roll is needed. Checks are reserved for moments of drama, risk, and consequence.

- Attribute Modifier: A character's innate talent provides a consistent, small bonus. This represents the character's baseline competence.

- Target Number (TN): The TN is the number you must meet or beat for the action to succeed. The GM sets this based on the opposition or the inherent difficulty of the task.

- TN 5 (Easy): A task with minimal opposition.

- TN 8 (Standard): The default difficulty for most risky actions.

- TN 11 (Hard): A task requiring exceptional effort or facing significant opposition.

### Net Fulcrum

Sometimes, circumstances grant a character multiple short-term advantages or disadvantages. The Net Fulcrum system evaluates the balance of those factors to determine whether a roll is made under Favorable, Unfavorable, or Neutral conditions.

How it works:

- Count all applicable positive Tags that would grant an advantage for this check (for example: [Focused], [Inside Knowledge], a beneficial piece of gear, or a narratively justified Tag granted by the GM).

- Count all applicable negative Tags that would impose a disadvantage for this check (for example: [Noisy Footing], [Shaken], environmental hazards, or a narratively justified negative Tag).

- If the number of positive Tags exceeds the number of negative Tags, the roll is a Favorable Net Fulcrum: roll 2d12 and use the higher result.

- If the number of negative Tags exceeds the number of positive Tags, the roll is an Unfavorable Net Fulcrum: roll 2d12 and use the lower result.

- If positives and negatives are equal, or if there are none, the roll is Neutral: roll a single d12.

Notes and interactions:

- Tags are the unit used by Net Fulcrum (see the Unified Tags section). Each Tag counts as one toward the Net calculation unless otherwise stated.

- Some effects may explicitly add +1 or -1 to the Net count; treat those as additional Tags for the purpose of determining Net Fulcrum.

- Net Fulcrum is additive and granular: multiple small advantages can overcome a single large disadvantage, encouraging teamwork and layered tactics.

- The GM may declare certain Tags to be situationally dominant (for example, a catastrophic environmental effect). In such cases, the GM should clearly announce that the Tag counts as 2 for Net calculations; use this sparingly.

### The Rule of Stacking

In ZD12, the same game effect from multiple sources does not stack. If a character would be affected by the same Tag, Stance, or other named ability more than once, they only benefit from it a single time. This encourages tactical diversity and ensures every choice is a meaningful one.

### The Degrees of Success

The outcome of every Core Check is determined by both the natural result of the d12 and your final total compared to the Target Number (TN).

- Critical Failure (Natural 1): If your die shows a 1, you fail in the worst possible way. The GM will present you with two distinct, calamitous outcomes and you must choose which one your character suffers. Gain +2 Grit.

- Failure: If your die roll is not a 1, and your final total is less than the TN, you fail the action. Gain +1 Grit.

- Mixed Success: If your die roll is not a 12, and your final total is between the TN and TN+2 (inclusive), you succeed, but with a minor cost or complication. Gain +1 Grit.

- Full Success: If your die roll is not a 12, and your final total is TN+3 or higher, you succeed at your intended action without any negative consequences. Gain 0 Grit.

- Critical Success (Natural 12): If your die shows a 12, you succeed brilliantly, gaining an additional benefit, regardless of your total. Gain 0 Grit. In addition to the exceptional narrative outcome, you may choose one of the following tactical benefits:

- Create an Opportunity: Choose an ally. They gain a Favorable Net Fulcrum on their next check.

- Impose a Detriment: Choose an opponent. They gain a relevant negative Tag (such as [Exposed] or [Staggered]).

- Press the Attack: Immediately make a second, basic attack against the same target.

- Perfect Execution: Bypass an intended cost of the action (e.g., avoid a Throe, don't spend a resource) AND regain 1 Grit.

### Skills & Task Resolution

While the Core Check governs all risky actions, some tasks require specific training, honed talent, or specialized knowledge beyond raw ability. When the outcome of such a task is in doubt, you make a Skill Check.

In ZD12, a character's ability to perform specialized tasks is governed by two interconnected concepts: Skills and Tags.

- Skills represent formal training and provide a consistent, minor bonus.

- Tags (Unified) represent the ever-changing circumstances of the world and provide a powerful, situational advantage or disadvantage.

#### Skills

Skills are broad areas of expertise a character has honed through practice and study. The ZD12 system uses a fixed list of 12 skills, each tied to one of the four core Attributes.

##### Skill Proficiency

If a character is proficient in a skill, they gain a +1 bonus to any Core Check made using that skill. This reflects their training and muscle memory. If a character is not proficient, they may still attempt the check, but they do not add any bonus beyond their relevant Attribute modifier.

Example: Valeria, who is proficient in the Athletics skill, needs to leap across a chasm. She adds her MGT modifier (+2) and her proficiency bonus (+1) for a total bonus of +3 to her d12 roll.

##### The Skill List

- Might (MGT): Athletics, Intimidation, Might

- Agility (AGI): Acrobatics, Stealth, Thievery

- Wits (WIT): Awareness, Investigation, Tactics

- Spirit (SPI): Discourse, Performance, Resolve

#### Unified Tags

Where Skills represent a character's internal training, Unified Tags represent the temporary, narrative-driven conditions that affect a specific character, object, or situation.

- Tags are named descriptors (for example: [Focused], [Noisy Footing], [Exposed]) that communicate a clear in-fiction reason for the modifier.

- Tags do not provide flat numeric bonuses. Instead, they affect the roll state via Net Fulcrum and may interact with specific abilities that reference them.

Rules for Tags:

- Duration: Unless otherwise specified, a Tag lasts until the end of the scene. Some Tags specify shorter durations (one check, one encounter, or one action).

- Stacking: Each instance of a Tag counts as one toward Net Fulcrum calculations even if several sources grant the same Tag name; exceptions must be explicit.

- Application: The GM is the final arbiter for when a Tag applies. Players should describe how their actions create or exploit Tags; good fiction can earn mechanical advantage.

Cross-reference: Tags are the unit used by Net Fulcrum. See the Net Fulcrum section for how Tags determine Favorable, Neutral, or Unfavorable roll states.

## Chapter 3: Combat & Grit

Combat in ZD12 is designed to be fast, lethal, and driven by meaningful choices. It is governed by the "active attacker" philosophy: the player making an attack is the one who rolls the dice.

### The Combat Round

Combat is resolved in rounds. During a round, each participant takes a turn. On your turn, you have access to a set of actions known as the Action Economy.

#### The Action Economy

On your turn each round, you can take:

- 1 Major Action: Your primary, significant action for the turn, such as making an attack or using a powerful ability.

- 1 Minor Action: A quick, supplementary action, like moving one distance band, drawing a weapon, or adopting a Stance.

- 1 Reaction: An action taken outside of your turn in response to a specific trigger. You have one Reaction per round.

##### Action Summary

| Action Type  | Cost        | Common Examples                                                        |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Major Action | 1 per turn  | Attacking an enemy, using a powerful ability, casting a spell.         |
| Minor Action | 1 per turn  | Moving a short distance, drawing a weapon, opening a door.             |
| Reaction     | 1 per round | Making an opportunity attack, using a defensive ability when targeted. |

You may trade your Major Action for an additional Minor Action, but you cannot trade a Minor Action for a Major Action.

### Distance & Movement

ZD12 uses abstract Distance Bands to manage positioning:

- Close: Within arm's reach, the range for most melee combat.

- Reach: Several meters away; requires a Minor Action to move to Close.

- Near: Within a standard room; requires a Major Action to move to Close.

- Far: The maximum range for most projectile weapons; requires a full turn of movement to reach Close.

### The Anatomy of an Attack

All attacks follow a clear, step-by-step sequence based on the Core Check mechanic.

1. Declare Action: The attacker chooses their target, weapon, and any relevant abilities.

2. Determine Target Number (TN): The GM determines the TN for the attack. The default TN to hit any target is 8. This base TN is then modified by the target's specific defenses. Formula: TN = 8 + Target's AV Modifiers

3. Attacker Makes a Core Check: The attacker makes a Core Check (1d12 + Attribute vs. TN) to see if they hit. The Attribute used is typically Might (MGT) for melee or Agility (AGI) for ranged and finesse attacks.

4. Determine Outcome: The attacker's Degree of Success determines the result.
- Failure (Result < TN): The attack misses.

- Mixed Success (Result TN to TN+2): The attack hits, but potentially triggers the target's Throes effect (50-50 odds, flip a coin). The attacker then rolls for damage.

- Full Success (Result >= TN+3): The attack hits cleanly. The attacker rolls for damage.

- Critical Success (Natural 12): The attack is a Critical Hit, typically dealing damage twice. The attacker rolls damage.
5. Calculate Damage: If the attack hits, the attacker rolls their weapon's Damage Die. The target subtracts their Damage Reduction (DR) from the total rolled damage. A minimum of 1 damage is always dealt on a successful hit.

### Combat Stances

At the start of your turn, you can declare a Stance as a Minor Action. Your stance dictates your tactical focus for the round.

- Aggressive Stance: You focus entirely on offense. You can perform aggressive Gambits and may spend your Minor Action to gain the [Focused] tag for your next attack this turn.

- Defensive Stance: You prioritize survival. You can perform defensive Gambits and may spend your Minor Action to gain the [Guarded] tag for any defense check before your next turn.

- Balanced Stance: You remain flexible, the pivot point of the battle. You can perform utility-focused Gambits. Your benefit is unparalleled tactical flexibility.

### Grit: The Engine of Momentum

Grit is a resource representing momentum, luck, and determination. Only Player Characters may generate, gain, and use Grit.

#### Gaining Grit

- Gain +1 Grit on any result other than a Full Success or Critical Success

- Gain an additional +1 Grit when you roll a natural 1.

- Grit Cap: You can hold a maximum of 3 Grit. All Grit is reset to zero at the end of any scene or combat encounter.

#### Spending Grit

You may only perform ONE of the following Universal Spends per turn. Specific Signature Moves may have their own Grit costs.

- 1 Grit:

- Take an additional Minor Action.

- 2 Grit:

- Enhance any one roll by imparting a +1 bonus to the result.

- Give 1 Grit to an ally you can see and speak to.

- 3 Grit:

- Take an additional Major Action.

- Perform a Reaction (act out-of-turn in response to a trigger).

#### The Devil's Bargain

Sometimes, you need a burst of momentum right now and can't wait for a setback to fuel you. For that, there is the Devil's Bargain.

Once per scene, you can choose to personally advance any active Threat Clock by one segment to immediately gain 1 Grit.

This is a conscious trade of long-term safety for short-term power. You are willingly bringing the opposition one step closer to their goal, or a new disaster one tick nearer, in exchange for the resources to handle the immediate crisis. Choose wisely.

## Chapter 4: Damage, Defeat, & Progression

Combat is dangerous, and its consequences can be lasting.

### Health, Damage, and Armor

- Health Points (HP): Your HP represents your ability to withstand physical harm. When you reach 0 HP, you are taken out of the fight.

- Damage Reduction (DR): Armor and other protective effects may provide DR. When you take damage, subtract your DR from the incoming total. A minimum of 1 damage is always dealt on a successful hit, regardless of DR.

- Avoidance Value (AV): Armor and other protective effects may provide AV instead of DR. When suffering an attack, add the AV to your to-hit target number. This does not mitigate damage, but improves the chance of being missed entirely.

### Reaching Zero HP

When your HP is reduced to 0, you are Broken. You are not dead, but you are incapacitated and out of the fight. You will fall prone and cannot take any actions. At the end of your next turn, if you are still at 0 HP, you must make a roll on the Death's Door Table.

A character's Health Points (HP) cannot be reduced below 0. When damage reduces a character to exactly 0 HP, they are immediately considered Broken. Any damage dealt by an attack beyond the amount required to reduce the character to 0 HP is ignored.

While Broken:

- You immediately fall prone.

- On your turn, you can only take a single Minor Action (e.g., Crawl one distance band, speak a few words, drink a potion).

- You cannot take Major Actions or Reactions.

- Any damage you take while Broken forces you to immediately roll on the Death's Door Table.

- An ally can use a Major Action and make a TN 8 Wits check to stabilize you, removing you from danger.

### Death's Door Table (Roll 1d12)

| d12 Roll | Outcome          | Mechanical Effect & Narrative Hook                                                                                                                                                 |

### Mortal Wounds Library

A Mortal Wound is a defining moment, a brush with death that changes a character forever. It leaves a permanent narrative mark—a story etched into their body, mind, or soul.

While the scar itself is a permanent part of your character's story, its most severe mechanical effects are acute and temporary. The mechanical penalty listed under "Effect" lasts only for the remainder of the current adventure. Once the adventure concludes, the character adapts, and the specific mechanical hindrance fades.

For Game Masters running long-form campaigns, the "Path to Recovery" can be used as a personal story hook for a character to overcome their limitations before the adventure's end.

#### Might Scars (Brute Force Trauma)

- Shattered Limb: One of your limbs is permanently damaged, perhaps crudely set or replaced with a simple prosthetic.

- Effect: For the remainder of this adventure, you cannot wield two-handed items. When you attempt a feat of strength that requires two hands, you have an Unfavorable Net Fulcrum.

- Path to Recovery: The penalty fades at the adventure's conclusion. In a campaign, a GM may offer a quest involving master-level surgery or esoteric means to remove the penalty early.

- Internal Injuries: Your core is weakened, leaving you with a constant, deep ache.

- Effect: For the remainder of this adventure, your HP maximum is permanently reduced by 2.

- Path to Recovery: The penalty fades at the adventure's conclusion. In a campaign, a GM may offer a quest involving specialized alchemy or magical healing to restore your body's vigor early.

#### Agility Scars (Precise or Debilitating Damage)

- Limping Gait: A leg injury has permanently affected your mobility.

- Effect: For the remainder of this adventure, your base movement is considered one distance band lower for tactical movement.

- Path to Recovery: The penalty fades at the adventure's conclusion. In a campaign, a GM may offer a quest to acquire a masterwork prosthetic or receive miraculous healing to restore your mobility early.

- Nerve Damage: Your hands are unsteady, and your fine motor skills are compromised.

- Effect: For the remainder of this adventure, you have an Unfavorable Net Fulcrum on all checks requiring delicate manipulation, such as picking a lock or disarming a complex trap.

- Path to Recovery: The penalty fades at the adventure's conclusion. In a campaign, a GM may offer a quest involving a rare regenerative procedure to steady your hands early.

#### Wits Scars (Mental or Sensory Trauma)

- Fuzzy Memory: The trauma has left gaps in your memory.

- Effect: For the remainder of this adventure, work with your GM to identify a significant skill, contact, or piece of knowledge your character has forgotten. You can no longer add your Skill bonus for that specific knowledge.

- Path to Recovery: The penalty fades at the adventure's conclusion. In a campaign, a GM may offer a quest involving a powerful narrative trigger to restore the lost memory early.

- Sensory Impairment: Your sight or hearing has been permanently damaged.

- Effect: For the remainder of this adventure, you have an Unfavorable Net Fulcrum on all perception-based checks that rely on the affected sense.

- Path to Recovery: The penalty fades at the adventure's conclusion. In a campaign, a GM may offer a quest to acquire a technological or magical replacement for the damaged sense early.

#### Spirit Scars (Psychological or Existential Trauma)

- Broken Confidence: Your brush with death has left you hesitant and fearful.

- Effect: For the remainder of this adventure, the first time you take damage in any combat, you gain the [Shaken] Negative Tag.

- Path to Recovery: The penalty fades at the adventure's conclusion. In a campaign, a GM may offer a quest that requires a significant personal test of will to restore your confidence early.

- Haunting Visions: You are plagued by flashbacks of your near-death experience.

- Effect: For the remainder of this adventure, your maximum Grit cap is reduced by one (typically to 2 instead of 3).

- Path to Recovery: The penalty fades at the adventure's conclusion. In a campaign, a GM may offer a quest to find spiritual guidance or profound peace to silence the visions early.

### Character Progression

Progression is how your character grows in power and skill over time. Characters advance by earning Discovery Points (DP), which convert into Mastery Points (MP).

- Gaining DP: You gain 1 DP every time your character spends 1 Grit. The GM may also award DP for significant narrative milestones.

- Spending MP: When you accumulate 10 DP, they automatically convert into 1 Mastery Point (MP). You can spend MP between sessions to purchase permanent enhancements, such as new Signature Moves or increased Attributes.

## Chapter 5: Magic & Resources

From a dwindling supply of arrows to the cosmic energies harnessed by Relics, this chapter covers limited resources.

### The Resource Die

To track resources that are limited but not easily counted—like arrows in a quiver or oil in a lantern—ZD12 uses the Resource Die. When you use the resource, you roll its associated die. On a low result, the die is downgraded to a smaller size. When you roll a low result on the smallest die (a d4), the resource is fully depleted.

At the end of an encounter or scene in which you used the resource, roll its current die. On a result of 1 or 2, the die size degrades to the next step down (e.g., a d10 becomes a d8). When you roll a 1 or 2 on a d4, the resource is completely depleted.

The size of a given resource's die is determined by the tone of the game. Example: A Waterskin may have a default resource die of d4 in a desert campaign, whereas in an urban setting it may have no resource die and can be assumed to be unlimited.

### Relics & Attunement

Relics are items of immense power that offer capabilities far beyond mundane equipment. To unlock the full potential of a Relic, a character must first Attune to it, a process that takes time and effort, bonding the item's power to their own spirit.

#### Relic Resonance

Relics are not merely tools; they are artifacts that absorb the stories they are a part of. Over time, a Relic that is used in significant, dramatic moments can awaken, resonating with its wielder's own history and growing into something more.

##### Triggering Resonance

A Relic becomes eligible to resonate when the GM determines it has been used in at least three distinct, meaningful scenes, such as:

- The scene in which the Relic was first acquired.

- A scene where its use filled the final segment of a Progress or Threat Clock.

- A scene where it was instrumental in defeating an Elite or Master threat.

- A scene where its wielder suffered a Mortal Wound while using it.

Once this narrative threshold is met, the player can spend 1 Mastery Point (MP) during downtime to bond with the item, unlocking its Resonant Path.

##### Resonant Paths

The Relic's evolution follows one of three paths, chosen by the player with GM collaboration to fit the narrative.

- Path of Echo: The Relic gains a new, permanent passive feature that reflects its history. This often manifests as a situational Tag or a Favorable Fulcrum under specific circumstances.

- Example: A shield used to block a wyvern's fire might gain the Echo: "Grants a Favorable Fulcrum on checks to resist elemental damage."

- Path of Pulse: The Relic gains a new active ability. Once per scene, the wielder may spend 1 Grit to activate this Pulse effect.

- Example: A dagger used for a silent assassination might gain the Pulse: "Spend 1 Grit to grant your next attack with this weapon the [Subtle] and [Precise] tags."

- Path of Mutation: The Relic undergoes a significant physical or functional transformation based on a key story event. This is the most dramatic evolution, creating a truly unique item.

- Example: After its wielder is brought back from the brink of death, a simple amulet might mutate into the "Last Stand Charm," absorbing the original's power and gaining the ability to be crushed to automatically stabilize its wielder without a roll.

##### Resonance and Progression

Using Resonant Relics is a direct way to push the story forward. When you use a Resonant Relic's Pulse or a feature from its Echo to directly advance a clock or defeat a foe, you gain 1 bonus Discovery Point (DP).

## Chapter 6: Examples of Play

This chapter provides practical, step-by-step examples of the ZD12 rules in action.

### Example: Making a Core Check

The Situation

Kaelen, a swift and cunning character with an Agility (AGI) of +3, is fleeing from Hegemony enforcers across rooftops. The GM describes a dangerous four-meter jump to the next rooftop.

The Check

- Stating the Stakes: The GM calls for a Core Check and clarifies the consequences. GM: "This will be a TN 8 Agility check to clear the gap. If you fail, you'll plummet into the alley below, taking damage and landing right in the path of their ground patrol."

- The Roll: Kaelen's player rolls a single d12 and gets a 7.

- The Calculation: The player adds Kaelen's relevant Attribute modifier to the die roll. Formula: 1d12 + Attribute vs. Target Number (TN) Calculation: 7 (d12) + 3 (AGI) = 10

- The Outcome: The player compares their final result of 10 to the TN 8. Because the result of 10 is TN+2, this is a Mixed Success.

The Resolution

The GM narrates the outcome based on the Mixed Success. GM: "You clear the gap and your feet land solidly on the opposite ledge, but you stumble on a loose brick, sending a clatter of debris into the alley below. The sound of the enforcers' shouts changes direction; they know exactly where you are."

### Example: A Round of Combat

The Situation

Valeria, a Stalwart with a Might (MGT) of +2, is in combat. She is wielding a Battle Axe (1d6 Damage) and wearing Hardened Hide Brigandine (+1 DR). She is in the Close distance band with a Corrupted Watchman (HP 12, DR 0). It is Valeria's turn.

The Turn

- Minor Action - Adopt a Stance: Valeria's player uses their Minor Action to enter the Aggressive Stance.

- Major Action - Attack Sequence: Valeria uses her Major Action to attack the Watchman.

- Step 1: Declare Action. The player states: "I'm attacking the Corrupted Watchman with my Battle Axe."

- Step 2: Determine Target Number (TN). The default TN to hit is 8. The Watchman has no armor that modifies this TN. The final TN is 8.

- Step 3: Attacker Makes a Core Check. Because she is in an Aggressive Stance, she can choose to gain a [Focused] tag for her attack. The player decides to do this, granting a Favorable Net Fulcrum. The player rolls two d12s, getting a 3 and an 8. They use the higher result, 8. They add Valeria's MGT modifier: 8 (d12) + 2 (MGT) = 10.

- Step 4: Determine Outcome. The result of 10 is compared to the TN of 8. Because 10 is TN+2, this is a Mixed Success. The attack hits, and the GM flips a coin to see if the Watchman's Throes effect is triggered.

- Step 5: Calculate Damage. Valeria's player rolls damage for her Battle Axe (1d6) and gets a 5. The Watchman has DR 0. Final Damage: 5 (Damage Roll) - 0 (DR) = 5 Damage.

The Resolution

The GM narrates the outcome. GM: "Your axe bites deep into the Watchman's corrupted form, but its unnatural resilience throws you off balance. It takes 5 damage, and its Physical Stress Throe triggers, imposing the [Exposed] condition on you until your next turn." The GM updates the Watchman's HP from 12 to 7. Valeria's turn is now over.

# Part II: The Game Master's Guide

## Chapter 10: Running the Game

### The GM's Core Principles

- Be a Fan of the Characters: Your goal is not to "beat" the players, but to present them with interesting challenges that let their characters shine.

- Telegraph Trouble Before It Strikes: Give players the information they need to make meaningful choices.

- Push the Narrative Forward: A failed roll should introduce a new complication, not bring the story to a halt.

- Principle of Narrative Causality: Anchor every mechanical effect in a clear, in-fiction cause. Rules should flow from believable actions and consequences.

### Using Clocks

A Clock is a simple visual tool to track progress towards a goal or rising tension. Draw a circle and divide it into 4, 6, or 8 segments. Fill in a segment when the characters make progress or a threat escalates. When the clock is full, the event comes to pass.

- Progress Clock: Use this to track the party's success in a complex task.

- Threat Clock: Use this to represent escalating danger.

### The Unified Tag System

In ZD12, a Tag is any temporary mechanical modifier applied to a character, object, or aspect of the environment. Tags are the primary source for the Net Fulcrum.

#### The Core Tag Library

This is a fundamental set of Tags. GMs are always empowered to create new, bespoke Tags as the narrative demands.

##### Character & Combat Tags

- [Blinded]: The character cannot see. They automatically fail sight-based checks and all of their attacks have an Unfavorable Fulcrum. Attacks against them have a Favorable Fulcrum.

- [Exposed]: The character has a gap in their defense. The next attack roll made against them has a Favorable Fulcrum.

- [Focused]: The character is concentrating. Their next attack roll this turn has a Favorable Fulcrum.

- [Guarded]: The character is braced for impact. The next defense check they make before their next turn has a Favorable Fulcrum.

- [Staggered]: The character is off-balance. They cannot use their Reaction until the end of their next turn.

##### Environmental & Situational Tags

- [Blocked]: A path is obstructed.

- [Cover]: A feature that can be used for protection, adding to AV or DR.

- [Darkness]: The area is unlit. Actions relying on sight have an Unfavorable Fulcrum.

- [Obscured]: The area is filled with smoke, fog, etc. Ranged attacks have an Unfavorable Fulcrum.

- [Unstable]: The ground is treacherous. Checks involving movement or balance have an Unfavorable Fulcrum.

## Chapter 11: Social Interaction

### Tier 1: Conversation & Inquiry

This is the baseline for most NPC interactions and is handled through freeform roleplaying. If a player attempts a simple risky social action, they make a single Resolution Roll against a TN set by the GM.

### Tier 2: The Discourse Encounter (Optional System)

For high-stakes social conflicts, this framework treats the social conflict like a unique form of combat.

- Composure: Their mental "health points," representing their will to continue the debate. It is often calculated as 5 + SPI. When reduced to 0, they are Swayed.

- Resolve: Their mental "damage reduction," representing their stubbornness or conviction. It is often equal to their WIT modifier.

## Chapter 12: Threats & Opposition

### Threat Anatomy

- Concept: A short description of its nature and tactics.

- HP (Health Points): Its physical durability.

- DR (Damage Reduction): Its armor or natural toughness.

- Damage/Effect: The damage it deals and any conditions it applies on a hit.

- Throes: The consequence the player triggers on a Mixed Success attack against it.

### The Throes System

When a player achieves a Mixed Success on an attack, they deal damage and have a 50% chance to trigger the monster's Throes. Full and Critical Successes do not trigger an enemy's Throe effect.

### The Threat Builder

#### Step 1: Define Concept & Tier

- Standard: The rank-and-file.

- Tough: More dangerous, specialized threats.

- Elite: Bosses and truly formidable foes.

- Master: The campaign-defining antagonists.

#### Step 2: Set Core Stats (HP & DR)

| Tier     | Recommended HP | Recommended DR |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Standard | 8-10           | 0-1            |
| Tough    | 12-15          | 1-2            |
| Elite    | 16-20          | 2-3            |
| Master   | 21+            | 3+             |

#### Step 3: Assign Damage & Effects

| Tier     | Recommended Damage    | Sample Effect (On Strong/Critical Hit)                          |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard | 1d6                   | "Applies a minor condition (e.g., Exposed)."                    |
| Tough    | 1d8                   | "Applies a serious condition (e.g., Staggered, Bleeding)."      |
| Elite    | 1d10 / 2x 1d6 attacks | Applies a debilitating condition or triggers a special ability. |
| Master   | 1d12 / Unique         | Scene-altering effects.                                         |

### Bestiary

| Monster            | Concept               | HP  | DR  | Damage / Effect                           | Throes                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | --- | --- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Corrupted Watchman | Relentless Sentry     | 12  | 0   | "1d6 Damage, Applies Staggered"           | Physical Stress        |
| Mire Ghoul         | Ambush Predator       | 8   | 1   | "1d4 Damage, Applies Bleeding"            | Position Loss          |
| Spire Bat Swarm    | Area Denial / Harass  | 10  | 0   | "1 Damage, Applies Exposed"               | Position Loss          |
| Ruin Crawler       | Armored Scavenger     | 6   | 3   | "1d4 Damage, Compromised on Strong Hit"   | Physical Stress        |
| Whispering Shade   | Incorporeal Tormentor | 10  | N/A | "1d6 SPI Damage, Doubt"                   | Doubt/Exhaustion       |
| Stone Guardian     | Golem / Obstacle      | 15  | 2   | "1d8 Damage, Shove to Near band"          | Physical Stress        |
| Thieving Gremlin   | Resource Thief        | 5   | 0   | "Steals item, Exposed on hit"             | Costly Delay (escapes) |
| Cult Fanatic       | Reckless Attacker     | 9   | 1   | "1d6 Damage, Gains Favorable Net Fulcrum" | Frenzied Retaliation   |

### The Recursive Threat Generator

This framework helps GMs generate unique threats on the fly. The GM is always encouraged to choose the result that best fits the narrative, or to roll for a spark of chaotic creativity.

#### Step 1: Roll for Archetype (2d6)

This roll determines the threat's fundamental combat role.

| 2d6 Roll | Archetype          | Role & Concept                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2        | Elite              | A superior version of another archetype. The rare "boss" or "champion."                                                                                                                    |
| 3        | Defender           | Protects other targets. High DR/HP, abilities like "Guard" or "Intercept."                                                                                                                 |
| 4        | Lurker             | Ambusher. Focuses on stealth, surprise attacks, and applying negative conditions.                                                                                                          |
| 5        | Controller         | Battlefield manipulator. Creates hazards and applies debilitating conditions.                                                                                                              |
| 6        | Artillery          | Ranged damage dealer. Stays at a distance and lays down consistent damage.                                                                                                                 |
| 7        | Brute / Skirmisher | The core of any fighting force. The GM can choose: the Brute (a straightforward, high-HP, high-damage melee threat) or the Skirmisher (a mobile attacker who dashes in and out of combat). |
| 8        | Leader             | Force multiplier. Buffs allies, gives them extra actions, or directs them tactically.                                                                                                      |
| 9        | Controller         | Battlefield manipulator. Creates hazards and applies debilitating conditions.                                                                                                              |
| 10       | Lurker             | Ambusher. Focuses on stealth, surprise attacks, and applying negative conditions.                                                                                                          |
| 11       | Defender           | Protects other targets. High DR/HP, abilities like "Guard" or "Intercept."                                                                                                                 |
| 12       | Wildcard           | A strange, unpredictable threat that breaks the rules.                                                                                                                                     |

#### Step 2: Determine Core Action (1d6)

Based on the Archetype, choose or roll on the corresponding table to generate its primary action.

##### Brute Core Actions

| 1d6 | Action Name    | Mechanical Effect                                                                                                                 |
| --- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Armor Break    | A standard melee attack. Degrades the target's armor; their DR is reduced by 1 for the next attack that hits them.                |
| 2-3 | Brutal Shove   | A standard melee attack. On a hit, the target is also pushed one distance band away.                                              |
| 4-5 | Reckless Swing | The Brute makes an attack with a Favorable Fulcrum, but also grants its target a Favorable Fulcrum on the next attack against it. |
| 6   | War Scream     | All player characters in Close range must pass a TN 8 Spirit check or gain the [Staggered] Tag until the end of their next turn.  |

##### Skirmisher Core Actions

| 1d6 | Action Name        | Mechanical Effect                                                                                                                                          |
| --- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Harrying Strike    | A standard melee attack. On a Mixed Success, no damage but [Distracted] Tag (Unfavorable Fulcrum on next Major action). On Full/Crit Success, deal damage. |
| 2-3 | Disengaging Strike | The Skirmisher makes a standard melee attack, then may immediately move one distance band away without provoking a reaction.                               |
| 4   | Exposing Feint     | A non-damaging maneuver. The target must pass a TN 8 Agility check or gain the [Exposed] Tag.                                                              |
| 5   | Dashing Strike     | The Skirmisher moves one distance band and then makes a standard melee attack as a single action.                                                          |
| 6   | Puncturing Strike  | A standard melee attack. If the target is suffering from any negative Tag, the attack ignores all of the target's DR.                                      |

##### Artillery Core Actions

| 1d6 | Action Name        | Mechanical Effect                                                                                                                          |
| --- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Suppressing Fire   | The Artillery targets an area. Any character starting in or moving into that area gains the [Pinned] Tag.                                  |
| 2   | Pinpoint Shot      | A standard ranged attack. On a Full or Critical Success, the attack hits a vital spot, and the target also gains the [Staggered] Tag.      |
| 3-4 | Arcing Shot        | A standard ranged attack that ignores the defensive benefits of cover.                                                                     |
| 5   | Overwatch          | The Artillery aims. If the target moves, the Artillery may use its Reaction to make a ranged attack that also applies the [Staggered] Tag. |
| 6   | Targeting Weakness | A standard ranged attack. This attack ignores 2 points of the target's Damage Reduction (DR).                                              |

##### Leader Core Actions

| 1d6 | Action Name          | Mechanical Effect                                                                                                         |
| --- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 3   | Command: Reposition! | The Leader chooses one ally, who immediately moves one distance band as a free action.                                    |
| 4   | Coordinated Tactics  | The Leader grants an ally the [Focused] Tag for their next attack this round.                                             |
| 5   | Rallying Cry         | The Leader chooses one ally, who immediately removes one negative Tag they are currently suffering from.                  |
| 6   | Command: Strike!     | The Leader chooses one ally, who may immediately use their Reaction to make a standard attack.                            |

##### Defender Core Actions

| 1d6 | Action Name       | Mechanical Effect                                                                                                                             |
| --- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Shield Bash       | A melee attack that deals minimal damage. On a Full or Critical Success, the target is also knocked back one distance band.                   |
| 2   | Bodyguard         | Designates one ally in Close range. The next time that ally is targeted by an attack, the Defender can choose to become the target instead.   |
| 3-4 | Hold the Line     | The Defender gains +2 DR, cannot be unwillingly moved, and any character attempting to move past them must first succeed on a TN 8 MGT check. |
| 5   | Goading Challenge | A target must pass a TN 8 SPI check or suffer an Unfavorable Fulcrum on any attack that does not target the Defender on their next turn.      |
| 6   | Intercept         | If a PC moves to engage an ally, the Defender may use their Reaction to move one distance band and make a melee attack against that PC.       |

##### Controller Core Actions

| 1d6 | Action Name        | Mechanical Effect                                                                                                                                           |
| --- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Debilitating Blast | A ranged attack that deals minimal damage. On a hit, the target also gains the [Staggered] Tag.                                                             |
| 2-3 | Tanglefoot Spore   | Choose a point in Near range; all characters in Close range of that point gain the [Hindered] Tag (movement costs double) until the end of their next turn. |
| 4   | Forceful Push      | One target in Near range must pass a TN 8 MGT check or be pushed one distance band directly away.                                                           |
| 5   | Create Hazard      | Creates a zone with the [Hazardous] Tag; any character moving into or starting their turn in the zone takes 1 damage.                                       |
| 6   | Chain Pain         | Targets a character who is already suffering from a negative Tag, then chooses a second nearby character; that second character gains one of the same Tags. |

##### Lurker Core Actions

| 1d6 | Action Name      | Mechanical Effect                                                                                                                                                      |
| --- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Ambush           | If hidden, this standard attack deals +2 damage. The Lurker is then revealed.                                                                                          |
| 2   | Venomous Strike  | A standard melee attack. On a hit, the target must pass a TN 8 MGT check or gain the [Weakened] Tag (deals half damage with attacks) until the end of their next turn. |
| 3-4 | Fade into Shadow | The Lurker may immediately make a Stealth check to attempt to become hidden, even if observed.                                                                         |
| 5   | Prey on the Lone | A standard melee attack. If the target is not within Close range of any allies, this attack is made with a Favorable Fulcrum.                                          |
| 6   | Ensnaring Shot   | A ranged attack that deals no damage. On a hit, the target gains the [Immobilized] Tag until they use a Major Action to pass a TN 8 MGT check to break free.           |

##### Wildcard Core Actions

| 1d6 | Action Name    | Mechanical Effect                                                                                                                                                      |
| --- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Grit Leech     | A ranged attack that deals no damage. On a hit, the target loses 1 Grit. If they had no Grit, they gain the [Weakened] Tag instead.                                    |
| 2   | Unstable Form  | When this threat is reduced to 0 HP, it explodes. All characters in Close range take 1d8 damage.                                                                       |
| 3   | Action Echo    | Immediately after a PC uses a Signature Move, the Wildcard can use its Reaction to create a minor, corrupted echo of the effect.                                       |
| 4   | Adaptive Armor | The first time the Wildcard takes damage from a source, it adapts. It gains +2 DR against that specific source for the rest of the encounter.                          |
| 5   | Symbiotic Link | The Wildcard is linked to another threat. Any damage dealt to the Wildcard is split evenly with the linked threat. The link is broken if the other threat is defeated. |
| 6   | Reality Anchor | While this threat is alive, no character (player or threat) in Near range can benefit from a Favorable Fulcrum.                                                        |

#### Universal Reactive Throe Table (1d12)

(When a player's attack results in a Mixed Success, the GM may flip a coin. On a success, roll on this table.)

| 1d12 Roll | Throe Name      | Mechanical Effect                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1         | Reposition      | The threat immediately moves one distance band, ignoring difficult terrain.                                                                                                                                  |
| 2         | Vicious Rebuke  | The threat lashes out. The attacker who triggered the Throe gains the [Exposed] Tag.                                                                                                                         |
| 3         | Tactical Shift  | The threat uses the opening to prepare its next move. It gains the [Focused] Tag for its next action.                                                                                                        |
| 4         | Bolster Ally    | The threat's cry of pain inspires an ally. One ally of the threat's choice within the Near band gains the [Focused] Tag.                                                                                     |
| 5-6       | Create Hazard   | The threat's impact, blood, or spilled energy alters the battlefield. The Close band around the threat now has the [Hazardous] Tag.                                                                          |
| 7-8       | Guard Up        | The threat recovers its footing. It gains +1 DR until the end of its next turn.                                                                                                                              |
| 9         | Obscuring Cloud | The threat releases a cloud of dust, smoke, or spores. It is now in an [Obscured] area until its next turn.                                                                                                  |
| 10        | Grapple         | The threat grabs onto the attacker. The attacker gains the [Immobilized] Tag until they use a Major Action to pass a TN 8 MGT check.                                                                         |
| 11        | Item Sundered   | The blow is caught on the attacker's gear. The player must choose: either their weapon or their armor is damaged, losing one key property (e.g., a weapon's Tag, 1 point of DR/AV) until it can be repaired. |
| 12        | Frenzied State  | The threat is enraged by the blow. For the next round, all of its attacks have a Favorable Fulcrum.                                                                                                          |

## Chapter 13: Setting Primer

ZD12 is setting-agnostic, but these foundational hooks can be used to create a default world of high-stakes adventure.

- The Shattered Reach: A chaotic sea of unnatural, island-eating mist, dotted with chunks of solid ground.

- The Iron Hegemony: A mainland industrial empire that survived a past cataclysm through rigid order and powerful artifice.

- The Cinderwood: A colossal, petrified forest on the edge of the Hegemony's territory that is slowly turning to iron.

- Adytum, the Silent City: An impossibly old city discovered on a stable, mist-shrouded island in the Reach.

## Chapter 14: The Bottom Line

This book is not a sacred text. It is a toolbox. It is a well-stocked workshop. I have tried to adopt a FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) philosophy for ZD12. If you're not a programmer, don't worry about the term. It just means this: what you’re holding is not a finished product designed for consumption, but a living engine designed for modification. You have my full and enthusiastic permission to break, bend, rewrite, and reinvent everything you find in these pages. Rip out a subsystem you don't like. Bolt on a new one from a game you love. Change the core dice. My greatest design hope for this project is not that you will play ZD12, but that you will be inspired to create your own flavor of it—a version so specifically tailored to your table's desires that it practically runs itself.

# Part III: Appendices & Indices

## Appendix A: Signature Moves Library

A Signature Move is a special ability a character can learn that defines their unique style. These moves often require spending Grit.

### MGT Signature Moves

- Sundering Strike: When you make a melee attack, you may spend 1 Grit before the roll. If it hits, reduce the target's DR by an amount equal to your MGT modifier (min 1) for the rest of the scene. This effect does not stack.

- Unstoppable: As your action, spend 2 Grit. Move up to your full speed in a straight line, moving through any Threats. Any Threat you move through takes 1d6 damage and must pass a MGT check or gain the [Staggered] Tag. You do not provoke reactions for this movement.

- Deny the Reaper: When damage would drop you to 0 HP, you can spend your Reaction and 1 Grit to ignore being Broken. You remain standing and can act, even with a negative HP total. You must spend 1 Grit at the start of each of your subsequent turns to maintain this. If you cannot, you immediately become Broken and roll on the Death's Door Table. Your negative HP total cannot exceed your MGT score.

### AGI Signature Moves

- Blinding Speed: When you take your turn, you can spend 1 Grit to gain an extra Minor Action.

- Acrobatic Dodge: When you are hit by a physical attack, you can spend your Reaction and 1 Grit to take only half damage, and you may immediately move one distance band away without provoking a reaction.

- Opportunist: When an ally's attack causes a Threat to gain a negative Tag, you can spend your Reaction and 2 Grit to make an immediate attack against that Threat.

### WIT Signature Moves

- Calculated Ricochet: When you miss with a ranged attack, you can spend 1 Grit to have the attack hit a different target within the same distance band of the original, dealing half damage.

- I've Read About This!: When you encounter a new Threat, spend 1 Grit to declare, "I've read about this!" You gain the [Prepared] Tag against that type of Threat for the scene. The [Prepared] Tag lets you choose one of these benefits each round as a Free Action:

- Anticipate Dodge: Impose an Unfavorable Net Fulcrum on the Threat's next defensive roll.

- Exploit Weakness: Your next attack against the Threat ignores 2 of its DR.

- Predict Trajectory: Gain a Favorable Net Fulcrum on your next defensive roll against an attack from that Threat.

- Tactical Repositioning: When an ally is targeted by an attack, spend your Reaction and 1 Grit. That ally can use their own Reaction to move within the same distance band OR gain the benefit of cover.

### SPI Signature Moves

- Soulfire Bolt: As an action, spend 1 Grit to unleash a bolt of spiritual energy. This is a magic attack that deals 1d12 + SPI in damage and ignores DR. On a Full or Critical Success, the target also gains the [Exposed] Tag.

- Aegis of Faith: When an ally is hit by an attack, spend your Reaction and 1 Grit. Your ally gains temporary HP equal to half a d12 roll (rounded up) + your SPI modifier. This temp HP is subtracted from the triggering damage first and lasts until the start of your next turn.

- Force of Personality: When you attempt a social check, spend 2 Grit before the roll to make it a Favorable Net Fulcrum.

## Appendix B: Gambit Library

### Aggressive Stance Gambits

- Reckless Attack: As your Major Action, gain the [Focused] Tag for a melee attack. If you do, you also gain the [Exposed] Tag until your next turn.

- All-Out Barrage: Make a ranged attack as your Major Action. You cannot move, but you don't suffer a penalty for firing at a target in Close range.

- Press the Advantage: If you damage an enemy, you can immediately move one distance band closer for free.

### Defensive Stance Gambits

- Hunker Down: Forgo your Major Action. Roll a d12. Gain temporary DR equal to half the result (rounded down) until your next turn.

- Shield Wall: If using a shield, use your Major Action to provide half your shield's DR bonus to an adjacent ally until your next turn.

- Set for Charge: Forgo your Major Action. If an enemy moves into your Close range, you may use your Reaction to make an immediate melee attack against them.

### Balanced Stance Gambits

- Feint: Make an attack roll. If you hit, you may choose to deal no damage to give the target the [Exposed] Tag.

- Tactical Assessment: Forgo your Major Action. You or an ally of your choice gains the [Focused] Tag.

- Reposition: After your Major Action, you may immediately move one distance band for free.

## Appendix C: Relics Library

### Common Relics

- Sentinel's Charm (SPI): (Attuned) Spend 2 Grit as a Minor action when hit to reduce incoming damage by 3.

- Bloodstone Amulet (MGT): (Attuned) (Passive) You may choose to suffer 1 damage to gain a +1 bonus on any MGT check before rolling.

- Smokesight Goggles (WIT): (Attuned) (Passive) You can see clearly through smoke, fog, or mist.

### Uncommon Relics

- Earth-Warden's Vambrace (MGT): (Attuned) Spend 2 Grit as a Reaction to give an ally in Close range +2 DR against one incoming attack.

- Ghostweave Cloak (AGI): (Attuned) Spend 2 Grit as a Minor action to become invisible until you move or take a Major action.

- The Inquisitor's Seal (SPI): (Attuned) (Passive) You gain a Favorable Net Fulcrum on checks to discern if someone is lying.

### Rare Relics

- The Berserker's Heart (MGT): (Attuned) When reduced to 0 HP, spend 3 Grit as a Reaction to drop to 1 HP instead and make a free melee attack with a Favorable Net Fulcrum.

- Blink Dagger (AGI): (Attuned) Spend 3 Grit as a Major action to teleport to any space you can see within Far range.

- Crown of Command (SPI): (Attuned) Spend 3 Grit and make a SPI check vs TN 11 to issue a one-word command to a target who can hear you.

## Appendix D: Glossary

- Action Economy: Your set of actions on a turn: one Major Action, one Minor Action, and one Reaction per round.

- Attribute: The four core statistics: Might (MGT), Agility (AGI), Wits (WIT), and Spirit (SPI).

- Avoidance Value (AV): A bonus to the TN to be hit, from armor.

- Backlash: A dangerous consequence from rolling a 1 on a Specialist Die.

- Grit: A player-only resource spent to power special abilities. Gained on failures and mixed successes.

- Health Points (HP): A measure of physical durability.

- Mixed Success: An outcome where the result is TN to TN+2. You succeed, but with a minor cost or complication.

- Mortal Wound: A grievous, permanent injury from the Death's Door Table.

- Relic: An item of significant power that requires Attunement.

- Specialist Die: A special die (d10 or d12) used for Specialist abilities.

- Stance: A character's combat posture: Aggressive, Balanced, or Defensive.

- Tags: Temporary, situational descriptors (e.g., [Focused], [Exposed]) that affect the Net Fulcrum.

- Target Number (TN): The value a character must meet or beat to succeed on a check.

- Throes System: A framework that gives threats unique actions when a player achieves a Mixed Success against them.

| Blades in the Dark (John Harper)                   | Position/Effect, structured consequences | Transformed improvisational consequence into the Degrees of Success system—making stakes calculable rather than negotiated |
| Powered by the Apocalypse (Vincent & Meguey Baker) | Player-facing rolls, move structure      | Adopted player agency through transparent odds, rejected move-based structures in favor of universal resolution            |
| Torchbearer (Luke Crane, Thor Olavsrud)            | Attrition economy, the Grind             | Abstracted logistical scarcity into Resource Dice and the Grit circuit—tension without bookkeeping                         |
| Into the Odd / Cairn (Chris McDowall, Yochai Gal)  | Minimalist chassis, inventory-as-choice  | Inherited bounded math and anti-inflation philosophy; made inventory thematic rather than simulationist                    |
| Numenera (Monte Cook)                              | Mystical archaeology, Effort system      | Abstracted "effort as resource" into Grit spending; mechanics-as-lore became a design principle                            |
| Symbaroum (Järnringen)                             | Corruption as mechanical decay           | Inspired the idea that moral/thematic weight could live in how systems degrade, not just narrative description             |
| Mothership (Sean McCoy)                            | Stress mechanics, forward momentum       | The Grit economy exists because Mothership proved that mechanical tension needs a clock, not just stakes                   |
| OSR Movement (various)                             | Rulings over rules, lethality            | Adopted emergent complexity through simple systems; rejected lethality-as-punishment in favor of lethality-as-consequence  |
| Fate Core (Fred Hicks, Leonard Balsera)            | Aspects, narrative permission            | Took the "toolkit modularity" philosophy but applied it to epistemic openness rather than mechanical plug-and-play         |
| D&D 5th Edition (Wizards of the Coast)             | Advantage/Disadvantage                   | The Net Fulcrum descends directly from 5e's elegant solution to modifiers—refined to allow granular team-based advantages  |

### Recommended Reading for Designers

The designers below shaped ZD12's procedural DNA and represent a tradition of framework-forward design—architects who understand that rigorous procedural systems don't compete with narrative, they generate it.

#### Kevin Crawford

Scarlet Heroes, Worlds Without Number, Stars Without Number, Cities Without Number

Crawford's procedural generation frameworks and solo-play architecture demonstrate that you can systematize GM responsibilities without sacrificing creative freedom. ZD12's modular philosophy and transparent probability descend directly from Crawford's commitment to usable, hackable design.

#### Andrea Sfiligoi

Four Against Darkness series (Ganesha Games)

Sfiligoi's accessible solo mechanics show that you don't need complexity to create tension, and you don't need a GM to tell a compelling story. His design approach—tight procedural loops that generate surprising outcomes—influenced ZD12's commitment to emergence through elegant constraints.

#### Erick N. Buchard

Buchard's work masterfully quantifies narrative emergence—proving that you can give dramatic beats mathematical structure without making them feel mechanical. His influence on ZD12 lives in the belief that consequences can be calculated, drama can be systemic, and emergence can be designed for rather than hoped for.

#### Alex T

Blackoath Entertainment catalog (prolific solo/GM-less design)

Alex T's sheer output and experimental approach to solo gaming demonstrate that iteration itself is a design philosophy. ZD12's willingness to make bold mechanical choices (the d12 focus, the Grit circuit, the Throes system) exists because designers like Alex T proved that you can take risks in a traditionally conservative hobby.

### On Narrative and Systems Engineering

These designers don't separate "story games" from "mechanical games"—they understand that thoughtful systems architecture is a storytelling technology. ZD12 aspires to that synthesis: mechanics that generate meaning, procedures that create drama, and systems that feel like they're telling you something true about the worlds they simulate.

[^1]: A note on foundational debts: This book—and the thinking that made it possible—would not exist without Sir Terry Pratchett. His Discworld novels taught me that systems could be examined with rigor and love simultaneously, that footnotes could be architecture, that stories operate on their own physics. The concept of "narrativium" (the elemental substance of Story) shapes how I understand emergence, meaning-making, and the relationship between rules and play. I never met the man, but his work fundamentally rewired my cognitive lens. Every game designer who treats mechanics as narrative technology, who believes systems can teach philosophy, who understands that laughter and profundity are not opposites—we all owe him more than we can articulate. GNU Terry Pratchett.
